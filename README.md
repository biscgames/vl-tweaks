# VL-Tweaks
Tweaks for the Luanti game VoxeLibre.
These can either be small or very useful!

## VL independent (can be used on any game)
- slightlyhigherjump: Increases jump height by a very small amount
- showlight_whenholdingtorch: Shows light when you hold any node that emits light
## VL dependent (only to be used for VL)
- rmhungerbar_whendamagedisabled: Turning off "Enable Damage" will remove the hunger hudbar, and its functionality
- disallowbreaking_whenswordholding: When holding a sword in creative mode, you cannot break any node (It will be a VL independent mod next update)
